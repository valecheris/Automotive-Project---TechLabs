# Used Car Price Prediction in the UK Market -  Determining the price of a used car based on its features

This project was part of the “Digital Shaper Program” hosted by Techlabs Düsseldorf in the winter semester 2020-2021. 

Finding the price of a used car needs a fair system of evaluation that not only benefits the buyer, but also the car dealer. The most important question that needs to be answered concerns the identification of the car features that can significantly affect the price. In this project, we have tried to answer this question using data science and machine learning algorithms. The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can predict the price of a used car based on its features.

A dataset containing 100,000 used cars from the UK was used. The dataset contains significant features of the used cars and the price it was sold in pounds (£). The dataset has been analysed (data gathering, data wrangling and data exploration) and then machine learning algorithms have been applied to it. Different machine learning prediction models were used to train the dataset. Based on the car producers, either the Decision Tree Regression Model or the XG Boost one have turned out to be the best models for price prediction with an accuracy ranging from 90% to 97%.
